# Walking with Cytron Servo Motor
Sample source code for DIY PR18. Project description : This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F876A to communicate with Cytron SC16A servo controller to control the biped that built up with Cytron servo motors and servo brackets. Now you can program the biped to move in the way you like.

There is 3 folder which are Source code C and hex file, Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80) Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry. http://forum.cytron.com.my/
